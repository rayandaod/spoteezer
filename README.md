# spoteezer
I am currently trying Deezer but have friends and family on Spotify.\
This repo will regroup some Deezer-to-Spotify utilities (and vice-versa).

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Deezer link to Spotify link (only track links for now)
Very useful to send Deezer music to Spotify users.

Usage: `python d2s.py [deezer_link]`

On Mac, you can use the following shortcut to quickly convert links:
